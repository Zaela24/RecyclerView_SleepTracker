# RecyclerView - SleepQualityTracker with RecyclerView app

This is the toy app for Lesson 7 of the [Android App Development in Kotlin course on Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud9012/).

## SleepQualityTracker with RecyclerView

This app builds on the SleepQualityTracker developed in Lesson 6.  In this version, the list of results is in a RecyclerView instead of a static ScrollView.

## Zaela's Notes

I attempted to do this as a branch in my SleepTracker repo, but GitHub doesn't count contributions to branches that aren't the master branch, so here we are.
