# RecyclerView - SleepQualityTracker with RecyclerView app

This is the toy app for Lesson 7 of the [Android App Development in Kotlin course on Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud9012/).

## SleepQualityTracker with RecyclerView

This app builds on the SleepQualityTracker developed in Lesson 6.  In this version, the list of results is in a RecyclerView instead of a static ScrollView.

## Zaela's Notes

For this lesson I implemented both list and grid views in RecyclerView and created an adapter class for RecyclerView to contain and draw the viewws. I also implemented a header in the grid version.
